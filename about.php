                significant social and cultural practice associated with a specific location that serves as a
                common reference or landmark for many people, cinemas are an essential component of
                cities and contribute to the maintenance of the collective memory. When a movie is
                trending which has just been released the tickets are always almost sold out depending
                upon the area the theatre is located so itâ€™s a major problem that usually a viewer goes to
                the theatre to watch the significant movie but when they try to book the ticket its already
                sold out which only troubles the customer and waste their time so its where this project
                comes to help. While using this web application a user can book their ticket without the
